# Limits

Krates is a **Free to use** service, and I intend it to keep it so. But being a free service we need to have some limitations to avoid abuse.

- Maximum allowed payload size cannot be more than [!badge variant="danger" text="100 Kb"] per request.
- [!badge text="POST"] , [!badge text="PUT"] and [!badge text="DELETE"] requests are rate-limited to [!badge variant="danger" text="20 per minute per IP address."]
- There is no limit on the number of records you store in a box, but please don't abuse the API by storing large datasets of more than [!badge variant="danger" text="5000"] records. This is meant for small projects and that's why it is offered FREE of cost.
- [!badge variant="danger" text="No Backup"] If your data is lost due to some technical issues, its lost forever.

!!! warning
These limitations may change in the future.
