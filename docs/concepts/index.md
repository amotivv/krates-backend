| Object     | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Krate      | A krate can be seen as a **namespace**: collection names wonâ€™t collide if stored in different krates. |
| Collection | A collection of records.                                                                              |
| Record     | The actual stored data.                                                                               |
